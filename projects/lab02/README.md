In this lab we were asked to build a professional resume using HTML and CSS.

I finished this lab relatively quickly because I already have a bit of experience with using HTML and CSS. I have some projects on my github account to support this. My main issue was that I didn't know I had to do a different pull command (I am used to doing 'git pull' for another project that I had worked on.)
