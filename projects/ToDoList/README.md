# 📝 To-Do Checklist App

A desktop to-do checklist app with time zone support, subtasks, tags, persistent storage, and a clean PyQt5 GUI.

## Features

- Add tasks with due dates and tags
- Tasks sorted into today's and upcoming
- Subtasks support (planned for extension)
- Time zone awareness
- Persistent storage (data survives app restarts)
- Minimal UI (inspired by native calculator pop-up feel)
